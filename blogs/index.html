<h1>Closure</h1>
<p>Combination of function and lexical environment within which function was declared.</p>
<p>Nesting of functions allows inner functions to modify outer function's variables even after outer function returns.</p>
<p>Execution of functions uses scope from when the functions were created.</p>
